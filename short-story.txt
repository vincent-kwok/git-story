Once upon a time, there was a group of novice programmers.
They needed to think of a cohort name but could not figure it out.
Ideas were presented but nothing seemed like a good fit yet.
They wanted something clever and relevant to their times.
This name would become permanently printed onto a t-shirt for all to see.
The programmers had until the next day to decide what the name would be.
Hopefully they make a wise decision.
